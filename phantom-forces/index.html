| nan | nan | nan | Please hover over the attachments to see notes for alternative options! If you are in HTML view and cannot see the notes, scroll right to the HTML View Note Sheets! | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | nan | nan | nan | We are in the process of updating the sheet for the huge v11.0.0 update! Stay tuned | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | nan | nan | Primaries | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | nan | nan | Assault Rifles | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | 0 | nan | AK12 | Z-Point | Muzzle Brake | Potato Grip | Yellow Laser | Armor Piercing | Hyperburst is still really good! Trust me (lll￢ω￢) Well rounded with very low automatic recoil and high velocity | | 10 | nan | AN-94 | Delta Sight | Suppressor | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | 7.62x39mm | Lowest base recoil out of all assault rifles (º □ º l|l) High minimum damage with slow RPM, but a unique 1800 RPM initial burst every trigger pull! | | 15 | nan | AS VAL | Delta Sight | Suppressor..? | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Extended Mag | Good at everything, but has very slow velocity and reload speed. If you miss the higher RPM it used to have, check out the Vikhr Suppressor SR-3M! | | 16 | nan | SCAR-L | Coyote Sight | ARS Suppressor | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Extremely consistent long range performance with slow RPM and low recoil. Range reducing attachments don't hurt a lot as the weapon always four taps! | | 20 | ⭐ | AUG A1 | Coyote Sight | Compensator | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Very long range values and almost no recoil with the right setup! Comparable to the SCAR-L, trading a little base damage for fire rate | | 22 | ⭐ | M16A4 | Delta Sight | Suppressor | Sideways Grip | Yellow Laser | 6.5 Grendel | I know this loadout looks crazy, but read the notes and the alt sheet!!! One of the best ARs with excellent recoil, fire rate, and customizability o(<em>°▽°</em>)o | | 25 | nan | G36 | Comp Aimpoint | Compensator | Romanian Grip | Yellow Laser | Armor Piercing | Great minimum damage and penetration with good accuracy. 23 minimum damage allows the weapon to kill at any range with 3 limb shots and 1 headshot! | | 28 | nan | M16A1 | Delta Sight | Muzzle Booster | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | M855 | Unique RPM heating mechanic with great handling and velocity. M855 is extremely powerful up close, but fires randomly deviating/tumbling bullets | | 31 | ⭐ | M16A3 | Delta Sight | Muzzle Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | 6.5 Grendel | Ubiquitous meta AR- low recoil, great at doing everything. Burst grouping is extremely strong with 6.5 Grendel, check the alt sheet!!! (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ<em>. ✧ | | 37 | ⭐ | TYPE 20 | Mini Sight | ARS Suppressor | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Extended Mag | Does everything both the SCAR-L and AK74 can but with a tiny bit more base recoil. Extremely high base penetration and access to a 40rd magazine! | | 39 | ⭐ | AUG A2 | Barska Electro | Muzzle Brake | Pistol Grip | Green Laser | 7.62x39mm | Able to three tap up close compared to the AUG A1, but has less overall ranged damage. 7.62x39mm has very powerful base stats and overall performance | | 42 | ⭐ | K2 | Delta Sight | Compensator | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Solid generalist auto in the same vein as the M16A3. Has the potential to three tap with a bonus torso multiplier, but has less friendly recoil in comparsion | | 45 | ⭐ | FAMAS F1 | Mini Sight | ARS Suppressor | Angled Grip | FAMAS G2 | Armor Piercing | High RPM with good range and moderate recoil. FAMAS G2 fires extremely fast and is one of the most powerful medium range autos in the game (゜▽゜</em>) | | 47 | nan | AK47 | Mini Sight | Muzzle Brake | Romanian Grip | Green Laser | Hollow Point | Generally power crept by the STG-44. Very high damage with similar ranges to some battle rifles! High initial kick, but good overall full-auto accuracy | | 52 | nan | AUG A3 | Coyote Sight | T-Brake | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Less three tap range than the AUG A2, but much lower initial kick- overall accuracy is similar to the AUG A1. .300 BLK is interesting, but outclassed | | 55 | nan | L85A2 | Coyote Sight | ARS Suppressor | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Nearly identical performance to the AUG A1. Fires slightly faster with higher penetration, but requires two headshots to three tap up close | | 64 | ⭐ | HK416 | Comp Aimpoint | Squad Barrel | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | Hollow Point | Read the notes! Solid overall and very similar to the M16A3, firing slightly faster with less penetration and different recoil. Hollow points are strong here! | | 74 | nan | AK74 | Delta Sight | ARS Suppressor | Sideways Grip | Green Laser | Default | Very consistent and strong! Extremely low recoil with excellent damage and range, but slightly below average fire rate | | 94 | nan | AKM | Mini Sight | Compensator | Romanian Grip | Green Laser | Hollow Point | Significantly lower initial kick, but worse three tap range (90) compared to the AK47 (118) 🍌Banana Mag 🍌 | | 103 | nan | AK103 | Delta Sight | BARS Barrel | Romanian Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | 103: Friendlier recoil and further three tap to the AKM, lower min damage. 109: BORN TO SWAY ACCURACY IS A F<em><em><em> 410,757,864,530 DEAD PHANTOMS | | 111 | ⭐ | TAR-21 | Delta Sight | ARS Suppressor | Folding Grip | Yellow Laser | Armor Piercing | Read the underbarrel and ammo note please (lll￢ω￢) Excellent performance at all ranges with high multipliers and RPM but noticeable horizontal kick | | 122 | ⭐ | TYPE 88 | Mini Sight | T-Brake | Romanian Grip | Blue Laser | 7.62x39mm | The TYPE 58 (7.62x39mm) is a direct upgrade to the AKM with better RPM and recoil! Default ammo is generally outclassed by the AK74 but has great hipfire | | 123 | nan | M231 | Delta Sight | ARS Suppressor | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | Armor Piercing | Blisteringly fast fire rate which somewhat makes up for the atrocious recoil (^∇^</em>) Hipfire loadouts are very powerful and technically more accurate | | 128 | ⭐ | C7A2 | Mini Sight | Muzzle Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | 6.5 Grendel | Lower recoil, lower damage M16A3. Read the barrel notes! You might find some gems rolling with the less conventional barrel attachments ┌(o^▽^o)┘ | | 144 | nan | STG-44 | Delta Sight | Compensator | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | 5.56x45mm | Very high potential with good recoil and damage, but a below average fire rate which punishes missed shots. One of the best overall assault rifles | | 211 | nan | G11K2 | Mini Sight | Muzzle Brake | Angled Grip | Yellow Laser | Default | Fast burst DMR with a 72 stud torso kill range. Buffed during the 2024 New Years update with greatly improved muzzle velocity and optic sway! | | nan | nan | Carbines | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | 0 | nan | M4A1 | Reflex Sight | ARS Suppressor | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | 6.5 Grendel | Easy to use starter carbine with good accuracy and handling but quick damage drop off. Abnormally stable from the hip, try playing with hipfire builds! | | 6 | nan | G36K | Delta Sight | ARS Suppressor | Sideways Grip | Green Laser | Armor Piercing | Extremely standard automatic weapon with a few small caveats. Laserbeam accuracy and amazing handling, but strong initial vertical kick | | 14 | nan | M4 | Mini Sight | Muzzle Brake | Stubby Grip | Full Stock | 6.5 Grendel | Burst weapon with high fire rate and low base kick. Competes with the MP5K/10 burst and M16A4, has more minimum damage compared to the M4A1 | | 28 | ⭐ | L22 | Coyote Sight | Muzzle Brake | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | Armor Piercing | Abnormally high minimum damage, extremely powerful! Similar to the AUG A1 and L85A2, having worse limb shot performance but better fire rate | | 32 | nan | SCAR PDW | Delta Sight | Compensator | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | 7.62x51mm | Generally overshadowed by the AK74 due to its higher minimum damage, but the SCAR PDW reloads faster | | 35 | nan | AKU12 | Delta Sight | Muzzle Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Super Armor Pier. | Outclassed by the M4A1 with slightly worse overall parameters but negligibly better overall accuracy (with the correct loadout!) | | 42 | nan | GROZA-1 | Delta Sight | Compensator | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Good mix of damage and fire rate with decent accuracy and a lot of different conversions to play around with. I like the GROZA-1 a lot personally | | 48 | nan | OTS-126 | Comp Aimpoint | Muzzle Brake | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | Default | Very similar performance to the UMP45 with a much greater magazine size but much bouncier recoil. Hipfire loadouts are more accurate than aiming! | | 51 | nan | AK12C | Delta Sight | T-Brake | Potato Grip | Yellow Laser | Default | Strictly a burst loadout, otherwise use 9x39mm or the GROZA-1 instead! Can be terrifying at close range with its 1000 RPM burst mode and good three tap | | 62 | ⭐ | HONEY BADGER | Delta Sight | Squad Barrel | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | Hollow Point | Nearly identical performance to the M16A3- integrally suppressed with better reload speed, but worse range and accuracy. Hollow points are extremely strong! | | 63 | ⭐ | K1A | Coyote Sight | Compensator | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Good fire rate and recoil with low base damage and an unusual torso multiplier. Still great overall, but very power-crept | | 69 | nan | SR-3M | Delta Sight | Vikhr Suppressor | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Extended Mag | If you miss the old AS VAL with 900 RPM, this is essentially the same thing with better medium range performance but lower minimum damage | | 79 | nan | GROZA-4 | Delta Sight | Default | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Default | Zero to hero thanks to the Halloween update! Extremely high maximum damage with excellent recoil and three tap range, but very very very poor velocity | | 86 | nan | MC51 | Comp Aimpoint | ARS Suppressor | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Silent | A very unique battle rifle archetype with below average damage but amazing utility and recoil. Any suppressor + silent ammo goes crazy on Warehouse | | 89 | nan | FAL 50.63 PARA | Delta Sight | T-Brake | Romanian Grip | Blue Laser | 5.56x45mm | Absurd combination of three tap range and fire rate with low but floaty initial kick. Easy head + limb two tap, dominates medium range | | 93 | nan | 1858 CARBINE | TA11 Acog | Muzzle Brake | Skeleton Grip | Blue Laser | Default | Sidegrade to the HENRY 45-70 with better RPM and mag size but lower velocity and penetration. .36 + Long barrel is a spicy but powerful sniper option | | 105 | ⭐ | AK105 | Delta Sight | BARS Barrel | Vertical Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | Probably the best assault rifle in the game right now: Similar performance to the M16A3 with absolutely no recoil and more RPM, but it can't be suppressed | | 114 | nan | JURY | DDHB Reflex | Muzzle Brake | Skeleton Grip | Blue Laser | Birdshot | Lots of potential on paper with crazy fire rate and headshot range, but burns through ammo quickly. Birdshot is actually really good! | | 125 | nan | KAC SRR | Coyote Sight | Default | Romanian Grip | Speedloader | Default | Very similar to the JURY, trading the utility of a torso kill range for slightly better fire rate and magazine size. Speedloader works much better here :) | | 127 | nan | GYROJET CARBINE | DDHB Reflex | Default | Angled Grip | Green Laser | Default | Borderline overpowered past 150 studs with crazy fast fire rate and the ability to one tap to the torso. Awkward ramp up velocity with other weird parameters | | 128 | nan | C8A2 | Delta Sight | Muzzle Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | 6.5 Grendel | 6.5 Grendel loadout, but the base gun wants other attachments- check the alt sheet! Excellent handling with a good effective range and high RPM | | 130 | nan | X95R | Delta Sight | Compensator | Pistol Grip | Green Laser | .300 BLK | I wanna make the X95R work so badly o(TヘTo) Good minimum damage considering its RPM, but its recoil isn't consistent enough compared to other autos | | 157 | nan | HK51B | Comp Aimpoint | Compensator | Sideways Grip | Green Laser | Hollow Point | Surprisingly lightweight and terrifying at point blank with expectedly horrendous recoil and range. Reaches 14.00 walkspeed with short barrel 👀 | | 222 | nan | CAN CANNON | DDHB Reflex | Heavy Can | Skeleton Grip | Blue Laser | .50 Beowulf | There's a lot of mix-and-matching you can do here, and it's pretty fun! Outclassed by other one tap weapons, but you're not using it to be meta anyway lol | | nan | nan | PDWs | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | 0 | nan | MP5K | Mini Sight | Long Barrel | Stubby Grip | Burst Grouping | 10mm Auto | Lowest recoil in class with an amazing time-to-kill up close, but very poor range and velocity. 10mm Auto is very strong, but much different than default | | 5 | ⭐ | UMP45 | Coyote Sight | Long Barrel | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | .45 Super | Excellent overall damage and range with relatively smooth yet shaky recoil. Extremely poor velocity makes it a little difficult to use at longer ranges | | 7 | nan | G36C | Delta Sight | Compensator | Romanian Grip | Green Laser | Default | One of the most potent close range weapons in the game, with excellent handling and recoil, just mind the initial kick | | 9 | ⭐ | MP7 | Delta Sight | Compensator | Sideways Grip | Green Laser | Armor Piercing | Excellent combination of fire rate, recoil, and penetration with low base damage. Solid performance in nearly every situation! | | 23 | ⭐ | MAC10 | OKP-7 | Carbine Barrel | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | .45 Super | Check the alt sheet!!! Most "viably customizable" PDW with tons of great loadout choices. Amazing close range performance, fast damage falloff | | 24 | nan | P90 | Delta Sight | Compensator | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Great auto for wallbangs with great magazine size, fire rate, and penetration on top of amazing accuracy. Do you remember March 26th, 2024? | | 36 | ⭐ | COLT MARS | Mini Sight | Squad Barrel | Angled Grip | Green Laser | Hollow Point | Amazing generalist auto after the v10.2.1 update- Long three tap range with excellent handling, penetration, and overall utility. Hollows &gt;&gt;&gt; Default!! | | 40 | nan | MP5 | Coyote Sight | Long Barrel | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Plus P | Generally overshadowed by the M4A1- Extremely low recoil with a good three tap range, but horrible velocity makes it difficult to use at longer ranges | | 49 | ⭐ | COLT SMG 633 | Delta Sight | Long Barrel | Romanian Grip | Green Laser | Hollow Point | Exceptional reload speed and hipfire stability with very fast fire rate, but rather high vertical recoil when aimed. Amazing TTK up to medium range | | 53 | ⭐ | L2A3 | Delta Sight | Long Barrel | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | .45 ACP | Good stats in every department with laserbeam accuracy and a very slow fire rate. Great performance to the head at all ranges with plenty of breakpoints | | 60 | nan | MP5SD | Coyote Sight | Default | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Plus P | Sidegrade to the MP5 with integral suppression and slightly lower base kick, but slightly worse range and velocity | | 66 | nan | MP10 | Comp Aimpoint | T-Brake | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Default | Sorta swept under the rug by the PDW rebalance update when it received heavy nerfs to velocity and recoil (lll￢ω￢) | | 71 | ⭐ | M3A1 | Delta Sight | Muzzle Booster | Vertical Grip | Retract Stock | .45 Super | A hidden gem from the PDW rebalance with absurd breakpoint ranges and recoil! Surprisingly versatile once you get adjusted to its low velocity and RPM | | 74 | nan | MP5/10 | Delta Sight | Long Barrel | Romanian Grip | Blue Laser | Default | One of the strongest three tap to RPM ratios in the game with excellent medium range performance and significant but controllable horizontal drift | | 77 | nan | UZI | Coyote Sight | Muzzle Brake | Vertical Grip | Extended Stock | Default | Excellent recoil with decent base damage and low fire rate. It also features a couple interesting conversions! | | 80 | nan | AUG A3 PARA XS | Delta Sight | Long Barrel | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | The best of both the MP5 and MP5SD with a bit less RPM, but super long ranges! (ノ</em>°▽°</em>) | | 84 | nan | K7 | Delta Sight | Default | Pistol Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Nearly identical, if not better performance than the COLT SMG 633. Suppressed by default with pretty friendly recoil compared to the competition | | 88 | nan | AKS74U | Mini Sight | ARS Suppressor | Romanian Grip | Green Laser | 7.62x39mm | Largely improved in the 2024 New Years update! Great overall performance across all three conversions with a preference for close range | | 92 | nan | PPSH-41 | Delta Sight | Obrez Barrel | Yellow Laser | Yellow Laser | Armor Piercing | A sidegrade to the P90- drops the high penetration and medium range damage for extremely high reserve ammo and even faster RPM! | | 98 | nan | FAL PARA SHORTY | Delta Sight | Compensator | Stubby Grip | Extend Stock | Default | Powerful punch at all ranges with excellent handling. Somehow gets blown out of the water by the 50.63 PARA and 50.00 damage wise, but handles faster | | 100 | ⭐ | KRISS VECTOR | Mini Sight | Long Barrel | Yellow Laser | Yellow Laser | .357 SIG | Lightning fast time-to-kill with moderate recoil and extremely poor velocity. .357 SIG is the star of the show, but it's been greatly nerfed in v11.0.0 | | 105 | nan | PP-19 BIZON | Delta Sight | Compensator | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | Default | VERY decent gun that has no reeal downside apart from velocity, gets the job done | | 108 | nan | MP40 | Coyote Sight | Compensator | Angled Grip | Yellow Laser | Default | Nearly identical to the L2A3- has the utility to one head + one limb kill up to roughly 50 studs with worse (but still extremely low) recoil | | 115 | ⭐ | X95 SMG | Delta Sight | T-Brake | Pistol Grip | Green Laser | 5.56x30mm | Arguably destroyed by the PDW rebalance, but the ZITTARA still has some niche usage! It has similar performance to the L22 with generally higher stats | | 121 | ⭐ | TOMMY GUN | Delta Sight | Compensator | Sideways Grip | Blue Laser | .45 Super | One of the largest benefactors from the PDW rebalance with extremely long breakpoint ranges and moderate recoil. 10mm Auto is very strong, but sways a lot | | 126 | ⭐ | RAMA 1130 | Delta Sight | Long Barrel | Vertical Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | Similar to the MP7- features an 80rd magazine with an accompanying fast reload speed, but horrible velocity and penetration | | 149 | nan | BWC9 A | Mini Sight | X-Ring | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | Extended Mag | Very similar performance to the M17- Identical damage/range and can fire full auto with laser recoil, but no torso multiplier | | 155 | ⭐ | FIVE-0 | Delta Sight | ARS Suppressor | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | 9x19mm | Nearly overtuned performance across all conversions with abnormally high handling but pitiful velocity. If the binary firemode is hard to use, try burst! | | nan | nan | LMGs | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | 0 | nan | COLT LMG | Delta Sight | T-Brake | Stubby Grip | Collapsible Stock | Default | Excellent range, damage, and recoil with no obvious disadvantages.

Similar performance to the AN-94 with a far three tap range but much slower handling and more camera shake | | 54 | ⭐ | RPK | Delta Sight | Compensator | Romanian Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | Generally the "best" performing 7.62x39mm AK with moderate recoil and very high damage. Can three tap up to 139 studs! | | 67 | nan | HK21E | Delta Sight | Muzzle Brake | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Probably needs no introduction- One of the most annoying weapons to fight with strong parameters, but horrid and heavily RNG dependent accuracy | | 72 | ⭐ | HAMR IAR | Comp Aimpoint | Muzzle Booster | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | Won't go down with my hamr Unique RPM heating mechanic with amazing stats across the board! | | 88 | nan | RPK74 | Delta Sight | Muzzle Booster | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Default | Power crept by the STG-N since the christmas update. Near identical to the COLT LMG- Better overall accuracy, but lower base fire rate and magazine size | | 101 | nan | MG3KWS | Delta Sight | Compensator | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | Default | Check the alt sheet if you want a "no recoil" loadout! Been through the rework grinder so many times, lukewarm with poor ranges and high recoil | | 118 | ⭐ | M1918A2 | Delta Sight | T-Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | A combination of the STG-44 and SCAR-H- Long two tap range and can infinitely three tap with accurate recoil, but slow overall handling | | 176 | nan | MGV-176 | Z-Point | Compensator | Sideways Grip | Green Laser | Default | Insane potential TTK with excellent recoil. Below average performance on paper if you don't hit headshots, but still serviceable due to its high RPM | | 196 | nan | STONER 96 | Coyote Sight | Compensator | Vertical Grip | Green Laser | Armor Piercing | If you miss the extreme long-range dominance of the old AUG HBAR, use this! (º □ º l|l) Plays like a very heavy SCAR-L with slightly slower RPM | | 226 | ⭐ | CHAINSAW | Default | Muzzle Booster | Yellow Laser | Yellow Laser | Armor Piercing | Powerful performance at every range with good accuracy and an absurd mag size. Why does this weapon even exist? | | 242 | nan | MG42 | AMT-Terminator | X-Ring | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | Default | A more polarizing version of the MG3KWS- more damage and fire rate, worse handling and recoil | | nan | nan | Battle Rifles | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | nan | | 2 | nan | M14 | Delta Sight | Compensator | Romanian Grip | Blue Laser | Default | Powerful starter battle rifle with horrible kick but an extremely fast TTK and very strong ranges. You'll definitely need some attachments for this weapon | | 21 | nan | BEOWULF ECR | Delta Sight | Muzzle Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Nearly unmatched close quarters presence with a fast two tap range but a small magazine. Both conversions (besides .410) are also very powerful (´▽｀) | | 30 | nan | SCAR-H | Delta Sight | Muzzle Brake | Yellow Laser | Yellow Laser | Armor Piercing | Extremely high damage with accurate but shaky recoil. Similar performance to the HK417- slightly better CQC, slightly worse LRC | | 44 | ⭐ | AK12BR | Z-Point | Halbek Device | Angled Grip | Yellow Laser | Armor Piercing | This is my gun ( ´ ∀ ) Weakest out of the battle rifles, but still has excellent damage performance with very low recoil and great reload speed | | 59 | ⭐ | G3A3 | Delta Sight | Suppressor | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Very high damage and range (even for its class) with an absurd headshot multiplier and near AN-94 levels of accuracy! Automatic DMR with weird recoil | | 76 | nan | AG-3 | Delta Sight | T-Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | Easiest to use in class- worse than the SCAR-H on paper, but carried by its 1.7x head multiplier and very low kick | | 78 | nan | HK417 | Mini Sight | ARS Suppressor | Pistol Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Has the ability to three-tap to the torso at any range with a lot of bounce, works excellently when tap-firing at longer ranges | | 96 | nan | HENRY 45-70 | Default | Muzzle Brake | Angled Grip | Remove Stock | Default | Good torso kill range and handling with below average velocity. Similar to a lot of slug shotguns with (generally) better stats | | 107 | ⭐ | FAL 50.00 | Delta Sight | Compensator | Romanian Grip | Blue Laser | Armor Piercing | Strong combination of three tap range, accuracy, and fire rate. Reloads a bit slower compared to other battle rifles | | 181 | nan | HCAR | Coyote Sight | Muzzle Brake | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | Requires a little finesse to use, but is extremely versatile!

Retains the ability to three tap at all ranges if you hit torso shots! | | 34 | nan | SL-8 | TA33 Acog | Marksman Barrel | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | .300 Whisper | Two distinct flavors with marksman barrel: Default ammo for a 30rd SKS with 3.2k velocity, or a 230 RPM SVU with much lower velocity! Both are very good | | 38 | nan | DRAGUNOV SVU | Delta Sight | Muzzle Brake | Romanian Grip | SVU-A Conversion | Default | An excellent archetype with a nearly unmatched balance of power and speed. While normally power crept by later DMRs, the SVU-A is very overtuned! | | 46 | nan | VSS VINTOREZ | Coyote Sight | Suppressor..? | Stubby Grip | Collapsible Stock | Hollow Point | Unique automatic mode with high overall potential and a very far two tap range. Excellent performance at all ranges, but below average velocity for a DMR | | 59 | ⭐ | MSG90 | PK-A | Muzzle Brake | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | After the PDW rebalance update, this is a rare case where both Armor Piercing and Hollow Point are amazing here! Play around with both flavors! | | 68 | ⭐ | M21 | PK-A | Suppressor | Angled Grip | Green Laser | Armor Piercing | Very powerful with the new AP changes! Similar performance to the MSG90 with a lower overall stat product but much cleaner recoil | | 70 | nan | BEOWULF TCR | DDHB Reflex | Muzzle Brake | Angled Grip | Blue Laser | .458 SOCOM | Arguably the most power crept DMR in this meta, but has some niche play with .458 SOCOM! New hollow points also work pretty great here | | 78 | ⭐ | SA58 SPR | Z-Point | Muzzle Brake | Stubby Grip | Blue Laser | Hollow Point | Hollows are extremely strong here!

I'm mixed about its buff (lll￢ω￢) | | 12 | nan | MODEL 700 | Vcog 6x Scope | Heavy Barrel | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | Default | Check the alt sheet for a .32 ACP loadout! Not too interesting in its current state, well rounded in every aspect | | 41 | nan | AWS | PM II | Default | Skeleton Grip | Marksman Kit | Default | Shoots surprisingly fast with an enormous magazine size, but has slightly below average velocity (￣▽￣)" The special SUBSONIC ammo is really fun! | | 65 | nan | BFG 50 | ACOG Scope | Heavy Barrel | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | Default | If you wanna turn your brain off for the day and just click on people, more power to you! But that doesn't make this weapon any less annoying (┬┬﹏┬┬) | | 82 | nan | AWM | Vcog 6x Scope | Suppressor | Skeleton Grip | Marksman Kit | .338 Norma | Jack of all trades with two interesting ammo flavors (❁´◡❁) .338 Norma has crazy torso damage at all ranges (96+) even if you miss headshots | | 84 | nan | TRG-42 | TA11 Acog | Heavy Barrel | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | Default | A nearly direct upgrade to the INTERVENTION with additional torso kill range and velocity but slightly less RPM. Has some interesting conversions too | | 91 | ⭐ | MOSIN NAGANT | PU-1 Scope | Suppressor | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | 8x50mmR | Doesn't have a lot of close range utility, but features great fire rate and a forgiving two tap at any range. It also has 3000 velocity again :D | | 104 | ⭐ | DRAGUNOV SVDS | PSO-1 Scope | Muzzle Brake | Blue Laser | Default | 10/4.5x54R | BEHOLD!!! High versatility across all three of its conversions with absurd RPM, magazine size, and versatility! One of the best snipers the game has ever seen! | | 136 | nan | M1903 | TA11 Acog | Air Service Barrel | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | Armor Piercing | Slower mosin with a great torso kill range and a couple of wacky attachments! Above average at everything, besides magazine size | | 138 | nan | K14 | KOM 10x42 | Suppressor | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | .308 Win. | Very fast handling and fire rate, but demands headshots more than other snipers. .308 Win fixes that issue while still being speedy (ヾ;￣▽￣)ヾ | | 150 | nan | HECATE II | Vcog 6x Scope | Heavy Barrel | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | .416 Barrett | A direct upgrade to the BFG 50 with significantly better RPM and uptime. The only real downside in comparison is how much more expensive it is lmao | | 160 | nan | FT300 | Coyote Sight | Integral Supp. | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | 7.5x55mm | Read the ammo note! Medium range torso kill loadout, this has so many special attachments that just don't mesh well with each other (* ￣︿￣) | | 170 | ⭐ | M107 | Coyote Sight | Suppressor | Skeleton Grip | Extended Mag | Default | Very powerful sniper with an extremely far torso kill range! The v11.0.0 update greatly buffed this weapon's recoil, and it's no longer in a rework limbo state | | 195 | nan | STEYR SCOUT | Global Offensive | Heavy Barrel | Skeleton Grip | Marksman Kit | Default | Fires so fast!!! ＼(º □ º l|l)/ One of the highest skill cap weapons in the game's sandbox.

Excellent starter shotty with a surprisingly good effective range, extremely compatible with Flechette | | 11 | nan | MODEL 870 | Delta Sight | Suppressor | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | Default | Very middle of the road- reaches slightly further than the KSG 12.

(￣ワ￣) | | 24 | ⭐ | DBV12 | AMT-Terminator | Suppressor | Green Laser | Retract Stock | Birdshot | Powerful, spammy shotgun with high spread but a good one tap range. DBV30-06 is very strong, albeit unorthodox and sometimes clunky | | 56 | nan | KS-23M | Delta Sight | PBS-1 Suppressor | Skeleton Grip | Remove Stock | Shrapnel-25 | High damage, longest reach out of any conventional shotgun with Shrapnel-25. Harder to use up close due to its tight spread and slow rate of fire (╹◡╹) | | 63 | ⭐ | SAIGA-12 | AMT-Terminator | Lengthened Barrel | Romanian Grip | Retract Stock | Birdshot | Extremely spammy with deceptively strong damage performance- still very strong after the Halloween spread nerf with nearly the same one tap range | | 81 | nan | STEVENS DB | Default | Muzzle Brake | Default | Remove Stock | Flechette | Read the ammo note! Well above average at everything with a quick follow up shot. Encourages a more passive play style due to the low shell count | | 87 | nan | E GUN | Coyote Sight | Default | Skeleton Grip | Crowd Control | Heavy Discs | One of the best weapons to play aggressively with! Lightning fast TTK up close with barely any recoil, but very poor minimum damage and velocity | | 112 | nan | AA-12 | AMT-Terminator | Muzzle Booster | Blue Laser | Blue Laser | 20rd Drum | If for some reason you wanted to W+M1 in this game, use this!
