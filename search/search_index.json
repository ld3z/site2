Follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Place a Chest: Begin by placing a chest on the ground where you want your shop to be.</li> <li>Place a Sign: Place a sign one block away from the chest. A common position is directly above the chest.</li> <li> <p>Write on the Sign: Interact with the sign to write the shop details. The format for the sign is crucial:</p> <p></p> <p>Here's what each line means:</p> <ul> <li>Line 1: Leave this line empty. The plugin will automatically fill it with your in-game name.</li> <li>Line 2: Enter the amount of items you want to buy or sell in a single transaction.</li> <li>Line 3: Specify the prices for buying and/or selling. This line uses a combination of price indicators and values.<ul> <li><code>B</code> indicates the price at which players can buy items from your shop.</li> <li><code>S</code> indicates the price at which players can sell items to your shop.</li> <li>Prices are separated by a colon (<code>:</code>).</li> <li>Examples of valid price combinations:<ul> <li><code>B 5:5 S</code>: Players can buy for 5, and sell for 5.</li> <li><code>B 5</code>: Players can only buy for 5.</li> <li><code>S free</code>: Players can sell to your shop for free.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Line 4: Specify the item being traded. You can write <code>?</code> on the sign, and the plugin will automatically detect the item from the chest when you're done writing the sign or after you click the sign with the item in your hand. Alternatively, you can write the item's name or ID directly. You can find the name of the item you are trying to sell by going to the Minecraft wiki.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Complete the Shop: Once the sign is correctly filled out and placed next to the chest, your shop is ready!</p> </li> </ol> <p>Here is an example of a completed shop sign and chest:</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"game-guides/","title":"Game guides have moved to here","text":"<p>The guides have been moved to their own seperate site due to the conflicting nature of what this site was going to be used for.</p>"},{"location":"tapestry-plugins/","title":"Tapestry Plugins","text":"<p>Plugins for the Tapestry by the Iconfactory.</p> Name Description fun.comick Shows latest chapters uploaded to Comick for a selected language custom.comick Shows latest chapters for a custom list of specific Comick comics com.xkcd Shows the latest comic from XKCD su.kemono Shows latest posts from Kemono"},{"location":"tapestry-plugins/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>To install a plugin in the Tapestry app:</p> <ol> <li>Download the latest release of the desired plugin.</li> <li>Save the plugin file in the Files app on your iPhone.</li> <li>Open Tapestry and add the plugin as a connector through the in-app settings.</li> </ol> <p>For configuration details, refer to the specific plugin's README.</p>"}]}
