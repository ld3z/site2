,,Primaries,,,,,,
,,Assault Rifles,,,,,,
0.0,,AK12,Z-Point,Muzzle Brake,Potato Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Hyperburst is still really good! Trust me (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢) Well rounded with very low automatic recoil and high velocity
10.0,,AN-94,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,7.62x39mm,"Lowest base recoil out of all assault rifles (¬∫ ‚ñ° ¬∫ l|l) High minimum damage with slow RPM, but a unique 1800 RPM initial burst every trigger pull!"
15.0,,AS VAL,Delta Sight,Suppressor..?,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Extended Mag,"Good at everything, but has very slow velocity and reload speed. If you miss the higher RPM it used to have, check out the Vikhr Suppressor SR-3M!"
16.0,,SCAR-L,Coyote Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Extremely consistent long range performance with slow RPM and low recoil. Range reducing attachments don't hurt a lot as the weapon always four taps!
20.0,‚≠ê,AUG A1,Coyote Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Very long range values and almost no recoil with the right setup! Comparable to the SCAR-L, trading a little base damage for fire rate"
22.0,‚≠ê,M16A4,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Sideways Grip,Yellow Laser,6.5 Grendel,"I know this loadout looks crazy, but read the notes and the alt sheet!!! One of the best ARs with excellent recoil, fire rate, and customizability o(¬∞‚ñΩ¬∞)o"
25.0,,G36,Comp Aimpoint,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Great minimum damage and penetration with good accuracy. 23 minimum damage allows the weapon to kill at any range with 3 limb shots and 1 headshot!
28.0,,M16A1,Delta Sight,Muzzle Booster,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,M855,"Unique RPM heating mechanic with great handling and velocity. M855 is extremely powerful up close, but fires randomly deviating/tumbling bullets"
31.0,‚≠ê,M16A3,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Ubiquitous meta AR- low recoil, great at doing everything. Burst grouping is extremely strong with 6.5 Grendel, check the alt sheet!!! (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ. ‚úß "
37.0,‚≠ê,TYPE 20,Mini Sight,ARS Suppressor,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Extended Mag,Does everything both the SCAR-L and AK74 can but with a tiny bit more base recoil. Extremely high base penetration and access to a 40rd magazine!
39.0,‚≠ê,AUG A2,Barska Electro,Muzzle Brake,Pistol Grip,Green Laser,7.62x39mm,"Able to three tap up close compared to the AUG A1, but has less overall ranged damage. 7.62x39mm has very powerful base stats and overall performance"
42.0,‚≠ê,K2,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Solid generalist auto in the same vein as the M16A3. Has the potential to three tap with a bonus torso multiplier, but has less friendly recoil in comparsion"
45.0,‚≠ê,FAMAS F1,Mini Sight,ARS Suppressor,Angled Grip,FAMAS G2,Armor Piercing,High RPM with good range and moderate recoil. FAMAS G2 fires extremely fast and is one of the most powerful medium range autos in the game („Çú‚ñΩ„Çú)
47.0,,AK47,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Generally power crept by the STG-44. Very high damage with similar ranges to some battle rifles! High initial kick, but good overall full-auto accuracy"
52.0,,AUG A3,Coyote Sight,T-Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Less three tap range than the AUG A2, but much lower initial kick- overall accuracy is similar to the AUG A1. .300 BLK is interesting, but outclassed"
55.0,,L85A2,Coyote Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Nearly identical performance to the AUG A1. Fires slightly faster with higher penetration, but requires two headshots to three tap up close"
64.0,‚≠ê,HK416,Comp Aimpoint,Squad Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Read the notes! Solid overall and very similar to the M16A3, firing slightly faster with less penetration and different recoil. Hollow points are strong here!"
74.0,,AK74,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Sideways Grip,Green Laser,Default,"Very consistent and strong! Extremely low recoil with excellent damage and range, but slightly below average fire rate"
94.0,,AKM,Mini Sight,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Significantly lower initial kick, but worse three tap range (90) compared to the AK47 (118) üçåBanana Mag üçå"
103.0,,AK103,Delta Sight,BARS Barrel,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"103: Friendlier recoil and further three tap to the AKM, lower min damage. 109: BORN TO SWAY  ACCURACY IS A F   410,757,864,530 DEAD PHANTOMS"
111.0,‚≠ê,TAR-21,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Folding Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Read the underbarrel and ammo note please (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢) Excellent performance at all ranges with high multipliers and RPM but noticeable horizontal kick
122.0,‚≠ê,TYPE 88,Mini Sight,T-Brake,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,7.62x39mm,The TYPE 58 (7.62x39mm) is a direct upgrade to the AKM with better RPM and recoil! Default ammo is generally outclassed by the AK74 but has great hipfire
123.0,,M231,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,Blisteringly fast fire rate which somewhat makes up for the atrocious recoil (^‚àá^) Hipfire loadouts are very powerful and technically more accurate
128.0,‚≠ê,C7A2,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Lower recoil, lower damage M16A3. Read the barrel notes! You might find some gems rolling with the less conventional barrel attachments ‚îå(o^‚ñΩ^o)‚îò"
144.0,,STG-44,Delta Sight,Compensator,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,5.56x45mm,"Very high potential with good recoil and damage, but a below average fire rate which punishes missed shots. One of the best overall assault rifles"
211.0,,G11K2,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Angled Grip,Yellow Laser,Default,Fast burst DMR with a 72 stud torso kill range. Buffed during the 2024 New Years update with greatly improved muzzle velocity and optic sway!
,,Carbines,,,,,,
0.0,,M4A1,Reflex Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Easy to use starter carbine with good accuracy and handling but quick damage drop off. Abnormally stable from the hip, try playing with hipfire builds!"
6.0,,G36K,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Sideways Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,"Extremely standard automatic weapon with a few small caveats. Laserbeam accuracy and amazing handling, but strong initial vertical kick"
14.0,,M4,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Full Stock,6.5 Grendel,"Burst weapon with high fire rate and low base kick. Competes with the MP5K/10 burst and M16A4, has more minimum damage compared to the M4A1"
28.0,‚≠ê,L22,Coyote Sight,Muzzle Brake,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,"Abnormally high minimum damage, extremely powerful! Similar to the AUG A1 and L85A2, having worse limb shot performance but better fire rate"
32.0,,SCAR PDW,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,7.62x51mm,"Generally overshadowed by the AK74 due to its higher minimum damage, but the SCAR PDW reloads faster"
35.0,,AKU12,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Super Armor Pier.,Outclassed by the M4A1 with slightly worse overall parameters but negligibly better overall accuracy (with the correct loadout!)
42.0,,GROZA-1,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Good mix of damage and fire rate with decent accuracy and a lot of different conversions to play around with. I like the GROZA-1 a lot personally
48.0,,OTS-126,Comp Aimpoint,Muzzle Brake,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Default,Very similar performance to the UMP45 with a much greater magazine size but much bouncier recoil. Hipfire loadouts are more accurate than aiming!
51.0,,AK12C,Delta Sight,T-Brake,Potato Grip,Yellow Laser,Default,"Strictly a burst loadout, otherwise use 9x39mm or the GROZA-1 instead! Can be terrifying at close range with its 1000 RPM burst mode and good three tap"
62.0,‚≠ê,HONEY BADGER,Delta Sight,Squad Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Nearly identical performance to the M16A3- integrally suppressed with better reload speed, but worse range and accuracy. Hollow points are extremely strong!"
63.0,‚≠ê,K1A,Coyote Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Good fire rate and recoil with low base damage and an unusual torso multiplier. Still great overall, but very power-crept"
69.0,,SR-3M,Delta Sight,Vikhr Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Extended Mag,"If you miss the old AS VAL with 900 RPM, this is essentially the same thing with better medium range performance but lower minimum damage"
79.0,,GROZA-4,Delta Sight,Default,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Default,"Zero to hero thanks to the Halloween update! Extremely high maximum damage with excellent recoil and three tap range, but very very very poor velocity"
86.0,,MC51,Comp Aimpoint,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Silent,A very unique battle rifle archetype with below average damage but amazing utility and recoil. Any suppressor + silent ammo goes crazy on Warehouse
89.0,,FAL 50.63 PARA,Delta Sight,T-Brake,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,5.56x45mm,"Absurd combination of three tap range and fire rate with low but floaty initial kick. Easy head + limb two tap, dominates medium range"
93.0,,1858 CARBINE,TA11 Acog,Muzzle Brake,Skeleton Grip,Blue Laser,Default,Sidegrade to the HENRY 45-70 with better RPM and mag size but lower velocity and penetration. .36 + Long barrel is a spicy but powerful sniper option
105.0,‚≠ê,AK105,Delta Sight,BARS Barrel,Vertical Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,"Probably the best assault rifle in the game right now: Similar performance to the M16A3 with absolutely no recoil and more RPM, but it can't be suppressed"
114.0,,JURY,DDHB Reflex,Muzzle Brake,Skeleton Grip,Blue Laser,Birdshot,"Lots of potential on paper with crazy fire rate and headshot range, but burns through ammo quickly. Birdshot is actually really good!"
125.0,,KAC SRR,Coyote Sight,Default,Romanian Grip,Speedloader,Default,"Very similar to the JURY, trading the utility of a torso kill range for slightly better fire rate and magazine size. Speedloader works much better here :)"
127.0,,GYROJET CARBINE,DDHB Reflex,Default,Angled Grip,Green Laser,Default,Borderline overpowered past 150 studs with crazy fast fire rate and the ability to one tap to the torso. Awkward ramp up velocity with other weird parameters
128.0,,C8A2,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"6.5 Grendel loadout, but the base gun wants other attachments- check the alt sheet! Excellent handling with a good effective range and high RPM"
130.0,,X95R,Delta Sight,Compensator,Pistol Grip,Green Laser,.300 BLK,"I wanna make the X95R work so badly o(T„ÉòTo) Good minimum damage considering its RPM, but its recoil isn't consistent enough compared to other autos"
157.0,,HK51B,Comp Aimpoint,Compensator,Sideways Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,Surprisingly lightweight and terrifying at point blank with expectedly horrendous recoil and range. Reaches 14.00 walkspeed with short barrel üëÄ
222.0,,CAN CANNON,DDHB Reflex,Heavy Can,Skeleton Grip,Blue Laser,.50 Beowulf,"There's a lot of mix-and-matching you can do here, and it's pretty fun! Outclassed by other one tap weapons, but you're not using it to be meta anyway lol"
,,PDWs,,,,,,
0.0,,MP5K,Mini Sight,Long Barrel,Stubby Grip,Burst Grouping,10mm Auto,"Lowest recoil in class with an amazing time-to-kill up close, but very poor range and velocity. 10mm Auto is very strong, but much different than default"
5.0,‚≠ê,UMP45,Coyote Sight,Long Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,.45 Super,Excellent overall damage and range with relatively smooth yet shaky recoil. Extremely poor velocity makes it a little difficult to use at longer ranges
7.0,,G36C,Delta Sight,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Default,"One of the most potent close range weapons in the game, with excellent handling and recoil, just mind the initial kick"
9.0,‚≠ê,MP7,Delta Sight,Compensator,Sideways Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,"Excellent combination of fire rate, recoil, and penetration with low base damage. Solid performance in nearly every situation!"
23.0,‚≠ê,MAC10,OKP-7,Carbine Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,.45 Super,"Check the alt sheet!!! Most ""viably customizable"" PDW with tons of great loadout choices. Amazing close range performance, fast damage falloff"
24.0,,P90,Delta Sight,Compensator,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Great auto for wallbangs with great magazine size, fire rate, and penetration on top of amazing accuracy. Do you remember March 26th, 2024?"
36.0,‚≠ê,COLT MARS,Mini Sight,Squad Barrel,Angled Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Amazing generalist auto after the v10.2.1 update- Long three tap range with excellent handling, penetration, and overall utility. Hollows >>> Default!!"
40.0,,MP5,Coyote Sight,Long Barrel,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Plus P,"Generally overshadowed by the M4A1- Extremely low recoil with a good three tap range, but horrible velocity makes it difficult to use at longer ranges"
49.0,‚≠ê,COLT SMG 633,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Exceptional reload speed and hipfire stability with very fast fire rate, but rather high vertical recoil when aimed. Amazing TTK up to medium range"
53.0,‚≠ê,L2A3,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,.45 ACP,Good stats in every department with laserbeam accuracy and a very slow fire rate. Great performance to the head at all ranges with plenty of breakpoints
60.0,,MP5SD,Coyote Sight,Default,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Plus P,"Sidegrade to the MP5 with integral suppression and slightly lower base kick, but slightly worse range and velocity"
66.0,,MP10,Comp Aimpoint,T-Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Default,Sorta swept under the rug by the PDW rebalance update when it received heavy nerfs to velocity and recoil (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢)
71.0,‚≠ê,M3A1,Delta Sight,Muzzle Booster,Vertical Grip,Retract Stock,.45 Super,A hidden gem from the PDW rebalance with absurd breakpoint ranges and recoil! Surprisingly versatile once you get adjusted to its low velocity and RPM
74.0,,MP5/10,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,Default,One of the strongest three tap to RPM ratios in the game with excellent medium range performance and significant but controllable horizontal drift
77.0,,UZI,Coyote Sight,Muzzle Brake,Vertical Grip,Extended Stock,Default,Excellent recoil with decent base damage and low fire rate. It also features a couple interesting conversions!
80.0,,AUG A3 PARA XS,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,"The best of both the MP5 and MP5SD with a bit less RPM, but super long ranges! („Éé¬∞‚ñΩ¬∞)"
84.0,,K7,Delta Sight,Default,Pistol Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Nearly identical, if not better performance than the COLT SMG 633. Suppressed by default with pretty friendly recoil compared to the competition"
88.0,,AKS74U,Mini Sight,ARS Suppressor,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,7.62x39mm,Largely improved in the 2024 New Years update! Great overall performance across all three conversions with a preference for close range
92.0,,PPSH-41,Delta Sight,Obrez Barrel,Yellow Laser,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,A sidegrade to the P90- drops the high penetration and medium range damage for extremely high reserve ammo and even faster RPM!
98.0,,FAL PARA SHORTY,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Extend Stock,Default,"Powerful punch at all ranges with excellent handling. Somehow gets blown out of the water by the 50.63 PARA and 50.00 damage wise, but handles faster"
100.0,‚≠ê,KRISS VECTOR,Mini Sight,Long Barrel,Yellow Laser,Yellow Laser,.357 SIG,"Lightning fast time-to-kill with moderate recoil and extremely poor velocity. .357 SIG is the star of the show, but it's been greatly nerfed in v11.0.0"
105.0,,PP-19 BIZON,Delta Sight,Compensator,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,Default,"VERY decent gun that has no reeal downside apart from velocity, gets the job done"
108.0,,MP40,Coyote Sight,Compensator,Angled Grip,Yellow Laser,Default,Nearly identical to the L2A3- has the utility to one head + one limb kill up to roughly 50 studs with worse (but still extremely low) recoil
115.0,‚≠ê,X95 SMG,Delta Sight,T-Brake,Pistol Grip,Green Laser,5.56x30mm,"Arguably destroyed by the PDW rebalance, but the ZITTARA still has some niche usage! It has similar performance to the L22 with generally higher stats"
121.0,‚≠ê,TOMMY GUN,Delta Sight,Compensator,Sideways Grip,Blue Laser,.45 Super,"One of the largest benefactors from the PDW rebalance with extremely long breakpoint ranges and moderate recoil. 10mm Auto is very strong, but sways a lot"
126.0,‚≠ê,RAMA 1130,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Vertical Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,"Similar to the MP7- features an 80rd magazine with an accompanying fast reload speed, but horrible velocity and penetration"
149.0,,BWC9 A,Mini Sight,X-Ring,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Extended Mag,"Very similar performance to the M17- Identical damage/range and can fire full auto with laser recoil, but no torso multiplier"
155.0,‚≠ê,FIVE-0,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,9x19mm,"Nearly overtuned performance across all conversions with abnormally high handling but pitiful velocity. If the binary firemode is hard to use, try burst!"
,,LMGs,,,,,,
0.0,,COLT LMG,Delta Sight,T-Brake,Stubby Grip,Collapsible Stock,Default,"Excellent range, damage, and recoil with no obvious disadvantages. Both conversions are very good as wellÔºàÔºæ‚àÄÔºæ‚óèÔºâ"

33.0,,MG36,Delta Sight,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Good fire rate and penetration, very fast reload for a 100rd magazine \(Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£)„Éñ If this weapon still had 23 minimum damage it would probably be meta"
37.0,,RPK12,Comp Aimpoint,T-Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Heavy AK12 with smoother kick but more horizontal sway: Burst is generally easier to use here. 7.62x39mm isn't crazy OP anymore (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢)
43.0,,L86 LSW,Coyote Sight,Muzzle Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Long range auto beam weapon. Similar performance to the AN-94 with a far three tap range but much slower handling and more camera shake
54.0,‚≠ê,RPK,Delta Sight,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,"Generally the ""best"" performing 7.62x39mm AK with moderate recoil and very high damage. Can three tap up to 139 studs!"
67.0,,HK21E,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Probably needs no introduction- One of the most annoying weapons to fight with strong parameters, but horrid and heavily RNG dependent accuracy"
72.0,‚≠ê,HAMR IAR,Comp Aimpoint,Muzzle Booster,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,Won't go down with my hamr Unique RPM heating mechanic with amazing stats across the board!
88.0,,RPK74,Delta Sight,Muzzle Booster,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Default,"Power crept by the STG-N since the christmas update. Near identical to the COLT LMG- Better overall accuracy, but lower base fire rate and magazine size"
101.0,,MG3KWS,Delta Sight,Compensator,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,Default,"Check the alt sheet if you want a ""no recoil"" loadout! Been through the rework grinder so many times, lukewarm with poor ranges and high recoil"
118.0,‚≠ê,M1918A2,Delta Sight,T-Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"A combination of the STG-44 and SCAR-H- Long two tap range and can infinitely three tap with accurate recoil, but slow overall handling"
176.0,,MGV-176,Z-Point,Compensator,Sideways Grip,Green Laser,Default,"Insane potential TTK with excellent recoil. Below average performance on paper if you don't hit headshots, but still serviceable due to its high RPM"
196.0,,STONER 96,Coyote Sight,Compensator,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,"If you miss the extreme long-range dominance of the old AUG HBAR, use this! (¬∫ ‚ñ° ¬∫ l|l) Plays like a very heavy SCAR-L with slightly slower RPM"
226.0,‚≠ê,CHAINSAW,Default,Muzzle Booster,Yellow Laser,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Powerful performance at every range with good accuracy and an absurd mag size. Why does this weapon even exist?
242.0,,MG42,AMT-Terminator,X-Ring,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,Default,"A more polarizing version of the MG3KWS- more damage and fire rate, worse handling and recoil"
,,Battle Rifles,,,,,,
2.0,,M14,Delta Sight,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,Default,Powerful starter battle rifle with horrible kick but an extremely fast TTK and very strong ranges. You'll definitely need some attachments for this weapon
21.0,,BEOWULF ECR,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Nearly unmatched close quarters presence with a fast two tap range but a small magazine. Both conversions (besides .410) are also very powerful (¬¥‚ñΩÔΩÄ)
30.0,,SCAR-H,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Yellow Laser,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,"Extremely high damage with accurate but shaky recoil. Similar performance to the HK417- slightly better CQC, slightly worse LRC"
44.0,‚≠ê,AK12BR,Z-Point,Halbek Device,Angled Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,"This is my gun ( ¬¥ ‚àÄ ) Weakest out of the battle rifles, but still has excellent damage performance with very low recoil and great reload speed"
59.0,‚≠ê,G3A3,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Very high damage and range (even for its class) with an absurd headshot multiplier and near AN-94 levels of accuracy! Automatic DMR with weird recoil

13.0,,SKS,Coyote Sight,Muzzle Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,More aggressive compared to other DMRs with faster fire rate and lower recoil. Retains the ability to three tap at all ranges if you hit torso shots!
34.0,,SL-8,TA33 Acog,Marksman Barrel,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,.300 Whisper,"Two distinct flavors with marksman barrel: Default ammo for a 30rd SKS with 3.2k velocity, or a 230 RPM SVU with much lower velocity! Both are very good"
38.0,,DRAGUNOV SVU,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Romanian Grip,SVU-A Conversion,Default,"An excellent archetype with a nearly unmatched balance of power and speed. While normally power crept by later DMRs, the SVU-A is very overtuned!"
46.0,,VSS VINTOREZ,Coyote Sight,Suppressor..?,Stubby Grip,Collapsible Stock,Hollow Point,"Unique automatic mode with high overall potential and a very far two tap range. Excellent performance at all ranges, but below average velocity for a DMR"
59.0,‚≠ê,MSG90,PK-A,Muzzle Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,"After the PDW rebalance update, this is a rare case where both Armor Piercing and Hollow Point are amazing here! Play around with both flavors!"
68.0,‚≠ê,M21,PK-A,Suppressor,Angled Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,Very powerful with the new AP changes! Similar performance to the MSG90 with a lower overall stat product but much cleaner recoil
70.0,,BEOWULF TCR,DDHB Reflex,Muzzle Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,.458 SOCOM,"Arguably the most power crept DMR in this meta, but has some niche play with .458 SOCOM! New hollow points also work pretty great here"

0.0,‚≠ê,INTERVENTION,Vcog 6x Scope,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,Excellent starter sniper with rather forgiving velocity and torso kill range. I'm mixed about its buff (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢)
12.0,,MODEL 700,Vcog 6x Scope,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,"Check the alt sheet for a .32 ACP loadout! Not too interesting in its current state, well rounded in every aspect"

65.0,,BFG 50,ACOG Scope,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,"If you wanna turn your brain off for the day and just click on people, more power to you! But that doesn't make this weapon any less annoying (‚î¨‚î¨Ôπè‚î¨‚î¨)"
82.0,,AWM,Vcog 6x Scope,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Marksman Kit,.338 Norma,Jack of all trades with two interesting ammo flavors (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°‚ùÅ) .338 Norma has crazy torso damage at all ranges (96+) even if you miss headshots
84.0,,TRG-42,TA11 Acog,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,A nearly direct upgrade to the INTERVENTION with additional torso kill range and velocity but slightly less RPM. Has some interesting conversions too
91.0,‚≠ê,MOSIN NAGANT,PU-1 Scope,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,8x50mmR,"Doesn't have a lot of close range utility, but features great fire rate and a forgiving two tap at any range. It also has 3000 velocity again :D"
104.0,‚≠ê,DRAGUNOV SVDS,PSO-1 Scope,Muzzle Brake,Blue Laser,Default,10/4.5x54R,"BEHOLD!!! High versatility across all three of its conversions with absurd RPM, magazine size, and versatility! One of the best snipers the game has ever seen!"
136.0,,M1903,TA11 Acog,Air Service Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Armor Piercing,"Slower mosin with a great torso kill range and a couple of wacky attachments! Above average at everything, besides magazine size"
138.0,,K14,KOM 10x42,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,.308 Win.,"Very fast handling and fire rate, but demands headshots more than other snipers. .308 Win fixes that issue while still being speedy („Éæ;Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£)„Éæ"
150.0,,HECATE II,Vcog 6x Scope,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,.416 Barrett,A direct upgrade to the BFG 50 with significantly better RPM and uptime. The only real downside in comparison is how much more expensive it is lmao
160.0,,FT300,Coyote Sight,Integral Supp.,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,7.5x55mm,"Read the ammo note! Medium range torso kill loadout, this has so many special attachments that just don't mesh well with each other ( Ôø£Ô∏øÔø£)"
170.0,‚≠ê,M107,Coyote Sight,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Extended Mag,Default,"Very powerful sniper with an extremely far torso kill range! The v11.0.0 update greatly buffed this weapon's recoil, and it's no longer in a rework limbo state"
195.0,,STEYR SCOUT,Global Offensive,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Marksman Kit,Default,"Fires so fast!!! Ôºº(¬∫ ‚ñ° ¬∫ l|l)/ One of the highest skill cap weapons in the game's sandbox. If you don't have it unlocked, try out the 10/3.5mm SVDS!"
200.0,‚≠ê,WA2000,TA11 Acog,Muzzle Brake,Skeleton Grip,Default,.300 Winmag,"The SVDS was nerfed, but this may be better! A lighter version of the M107 with much better recoil and handling, but a lower albeit still excellent torso kill"
220.0,,NTW-20,Global Offensive,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Default,Default,"The optic you use here is actually very important, read the notes! I should do a better analysis of this weapon at some point but I think it speaks for itself"
,,Shotguns,,,,,,
1.0,,KSG 12,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Blue Laser,Flechette,"Read the notes! Excellent starter shotty with a surprisingly good effective range, extremely compatible with Flechette"
11.0,,MODEL 870,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,Very middle of the road- reaches slightly further than the KSG 12. Did you know the M870 and KSG 12 have identical pellet spread? (Ôø£„ÉØÔø£)
24.0,‚≠ê,DBV12,AMT-Terminator,Suppressor,Green Laser,Retract Stock,Birdshot,"Powerful, spammy shotgun with high spread but a good one tap range. DBV30-06 is very strong, albeit unorthodox and sometimes clunky"
56.0,,KS-23M,Delta Sight,PBS-1 Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Shrapnel-25,"High damage, longest reach out of any conventional shotgun with Shrapnel-25. Harder to use up close due to its tight spread and slow rate of fire (‚ïπ‚ó°‚ïπ)"
63.0,‚≠ê,SAIGA-12,AMT-Terminator,Lengthened Barrel,Romanian Grip,Retract Stock,Birdshot,Extremely spammy with deceptively strong damage performance- still very strong after the Halloween spread nerf with nearly the same one tap range
81.0,,STEVENS DB,Default,Muzzle Brake,Default,Remove Stock,Flechette,Read the ammo note! Well above average at everything with a quick follow up shot. Encourages a more passive play style due to the low shell count
87.0,,E GUN,Coyote Sight,Default,Skeleton Grip,Crowd Control,Heavy Discs,"One of the best weapons to play aggressively with! Lightning fast TTK up close with barely any recoil, but very poor minimum damage and velocity"
112.0,,AA-12,AMT-Terminator,Muzzle Booster,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,20rd Drum,"If for some reason you wanted to W+M1 in this game, use this! Highest spread in class, default ammo is on par with most birdshot shotties (‚à™.‚à™ )...zzz"
120.0,‚≠ê,SPAS-12,Remove Stock,Muzzle Brake,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Flechette,Statistically a more forgiving MODEL 870 with double the fire rate and nearly identical range and spread
133.0,,DT11,Delta Sight,Combat Barrel,Angled Grip,Olympian Stock,Default,"Extremely tight spread and high pellet count with a lot of powerful, unique attachments! Combat barrel is notably powerful"
189.0,,USAS-12,AMT-Terminator,Muzzle Brake,Vertical Grip,Blue Laser,Default,"Impossible to beat at close range, but poor damage and quick ammo consumption. Did you know the USAS has slightly less pellet spread than the DBV12?"
