2,,,,Primaries,,,,,,,,,
3,,,,Assault Rifles,,,,,,,,,
4,0.0,,q,AK12,Z-Point,Muzzle Brake,Potato Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Hyperburst is still really good! Trust me (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢) Well rounded with very low automatic recoil and high velocity,,,
5,10.0,,q,AN-94,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,7.62x39mm,"Lowest base recoil out of all assault rifles (¬∫ ‚ñ° ¬∫ l|l) High minimum damage with slow RPM, but a unique 1800 RPM initial burst every trigger pull!",,,
6,15.0,,q,AS VAL,Delta Sight,Suppressor..?,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Extended Mag,"Good at everything, but has very slow velocity and reload speed. If you miss the higher RPM it used to have, check out the Vikhr Suppressor SR-3M!",,,
7,16.0,,q,SCAR-L,Coyote Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Extremely consistent long range performance with slow RPM and low recoil. Range reducing attachments don't hurt a lot as the weapon always four taps!,,,
8,20.0,‚≠ê,q,AUG A1,Coyote Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Very long range values and almost no recoil with the right setup! Comparable to the SCAR-L, trading a little base damage for fire rate",,,
9,22.0,‚≠ê,w,M16A4,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Sideways Grip,Yellow Laser,6.5 Grendel,"I know this loadout looks crazy, but read the notes and the alt sheet!!! One of the best ARs with excellent recoil, fire rate, and customizability o(*¬∞‚ñΩ¬∞*)o",,,
10,25.0,,q,G36,Comp Aimpoint,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Great minimum damage and penetration with good accuracy. 23 minimum damage allows the weapon to kill at any range with 3 limb shots and 1 headshot!,,,
11,28.0,,q,M16A1,Delta Sight,Muzzle Booster,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,M855,"Unique RPM heating mechanic with great handling and velocity. M855 is extremely powerful up close, but fires randomly deviating/tumbling bullets",,,
12,31.0,‚≠ê,w,M16A3,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Ubiquitous meta AR- low recoil, great at doing everything. Burst grouping is extremely strong with 6.5 Grendel, check the alt sheet!!! (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*. ‚úß ",,,

14,39.0,‚≠ê,q,AUG A2,Barska Electro,Muzzle Brake,Pistol Grip,Green Laser,7.62x39mm,"Able to three tap up close compared to the AUG A1, but has less overall ranged damage. 7.62x39mm has very powerful base stats and overall performance",,,
15,42.0,‚≠ê,w,K2,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Solid generalist auto in the same vein as the M16A3. Has the potential to three tap with a bonus torso multiplier, but has less friendly recoil in comparsion",,,
16,45.0,‚≠ê,q,FAMAS F1,Mini Sight,ARS Suppressor,Angled Grip,FAMAS G2,Armor Piercing,High RPM with good range and moderate recoil. FAMAS G2 fires extremely fast and is one of the most powerful medium range autos in the game („Çú‚ñΩ„Çú*),,,
17,47.0,,w,AK47,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Generally power crept by the STG-44. Very high damage with similar ranges to some battle rifles! High initial kick, but good overall full-auto accuracy",,,
18,52.0,,q,AUG A3,Coyote Sight,T-Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Less three tap range than the AUG A2, but much lower initial kick- overall accuracy is similar to the AUG A1. .300 BLK is interesting, but outclassed",,,
19,55.0,,q,L85A2,Coyote Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Nearly identical performance to the AUG A1. Fires slightly faster with higher penetration, but requires two headshots to three tap up close",,,
20,64.0,‚≠ê,w,HK416,Comp Aimpoint,Squad Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Read the notes! Solid overall and very similar to the M16A3, firing slightly faster with less penetration and different recoil. Hollow points are strong here!",,,

26,123.0,,q,M231,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,Blisteringly fast fire rate which somewhat makes up for the atrocious recoil (^‚àá^*) Hipfire loadouts are very powerful and technically more accurate,,,
27,128.0,‚≠ê,w,C7A2,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Lower recoil, lower damage M16A3. Read the barrel notes! You might find some gems rolling with the less conventional barrel attachments ‚îå(o^‚ñΩ^o)‚îò",,,
28,144.0,,q,STG-44,Delta Sight,Compensator,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,5.56x45mm,"Very high potential with good recoil and damage, but a below average fire rate which punishes missed shots. One of the best overall assault rifles",,,

30,,,,Carbines,,,,,,,,,
31,0.0,,q,M4A1,Reflex Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Easy to use starter carbine with good accuracy and handling but quick damage drop off. Abnormally stable from the hip, try playing with hipfire builds!",,,

33,14.0,,q,M4,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Full Stock,6.5 Grendel,"Burst weapon with high fire rate and low base kick. Competes with the MP5K/10 burst and M16A4, has more minimum damage compared to the M4A1",,,
34,28.0,‚≠ê,q,L22,Coyote Sight,Muzzle Brake,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,"Abnormally high minimum damage, extremely powerful! Similar to the AUG A1 and L85A2, having worse limb shot performance but better fire rate",,,
35,32.0,,w,SCAR PDW,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,7.62x51mm,"Generally overshadowed by the AK74 due to its higher minimum damage, but the SCAR PDW reloads faster",,,
36,35.0,,q,AKU12,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Super Armor Pier.,Outclassed by the M4A1 with slightly worse overall parameters but negligibly better overall accuracy (with the correct loadout!),,,
37,42.0,,q,GROZA-1,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Good mix of damage and fire rate with decent accuracy and a lot of different conversions to play around with. I like the GROZA-1 a lot personally,,,
38,48.0,,w,OTS-126,Comp Aimpoint,Muzzle Brake,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Default,Very similar performance to the UMP45 with a much greater magazine size but much bouncier recoil. Hipfire loadouts are more accurate than aiming!,,,
39,51.0,,q,AK12C,Delta Sight,T-Brake,Potato Grip,Yellow Laser,Default,"Strictly a burst loadout, otherwise use 9x39mm or the GROZA-1 instead! Can be terrifying at close range with its 1000 RPM burst mode and good three tap",,,
40,62.0,‚≠ê,q,HONEY BADGER,Delta Sight,Squad Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Nearly identical performance to the M16A3- integrally suppressed with better reload speed, but worse range and accuracy. Hollow points are extremely strong!",,,

42,69.0,,q,SR-3M,Delta Sight,Vikhr Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Extended Mag,"If you miss the old AS VAL with 900 RPM, this is essentially the same thing with better medium range performance but lower minimum damage",,,
43,79.0,,q,GROZA-4,Delta Sight,Default,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Default,"Zero to hero thanks to the Halloween update! Extremely high maximum damage with excellent recoil and three tap range, but very very very poor velocity",,,
44,86.0,,q,MC51,Comp Aimpoint,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Silent,A very unique battle rifle archetype with below average damage but amazing utility and recoil. Any suppressor + silent ammo goes crazy on Warehouse,,,
45,89.0,,q,FAL 50.63 PARA,Delta Sight,T-Brake,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,5.56x45mm,"Absurd combination of three tap range and fire rate with low but floaty initial kick. Easy head + limb two tap, dominates medium range",,,
46,93.0,,q,1858 CARBINE,TA11 Acog,Muzzle Brake,Skeleton Grip,Blue Laser,Default,Sidegrade to the HENRY 45-70 with better RPM and mag size but lower velocity and penetration. .36 + Long barrel is a spicy but powerful sniper option,,,
47,105.0,‚≠ê,x,AK105,Delta Sight,BARS Barrel,Vertical Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,"Probably the best assault rifle in the game right now: Similar performance to the M16A3 with absolutely no recoil and more RPM, but it can't be suppressed",,,
48,114.0,,q,JURY,DDHB Reflex,Muzzle Brake,Skeleton Grip,Blue Laser,Birdshot,"Lots of potential on paper with crazy fire rate and headshot range, but burns through ammo quickly. Birdshot is actually really good!",,,
49,125.0,,q,KAC SRR,Coyote Sight,Default,Romanian Grip,Speedloader,Default,"Very similar to the JURY, trading the utility of a torso kill range for slightly better fire rate and magazine size. Speedloader works much better here :)",,,
50,127.0,,q,GYROJET CARBINE,DDHB Reflex,Default,Angled Grip,Green Laser,Default,Borderline overpowered past 150 studs with crazy fast fire rate and the ability to one tap to the torso. Awkward ramp up velocity with other weird parameters,,,
51,128.0,,q,C8A2,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"6.5 Grendel loadout, but the base gun wants other attachments- check the alt sheet! Excellent handling with a good effective range and high RPM",,,
52,130.0,,q,X95R,Delta Sight,Compensator,Pistol Grip,Green Laser,.300 BLK,"I wanna make the X95R work so badly o(T„ÉòTo) Good minimum damage considering its RPM, but its recoil isn't consistent enough compared to other autos",,,
53,157.0,,q,HK51B,Comp Aimpoint,Compensator,Sideways Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,Surprisingly lightweight and terrifying at point blank with expectedly horrendous recoil and range. Reaches 14.00 walkspeed with short barrel üëÄ,,,

55,,,,PDWs,,,,,,,,,
56,0.0,,q,MP5K,Mini Sight,Long Barrel,Stubby Grip,Burst Grouping,10mm Auto,"Lowest recoil in class with an amazing time-to-kill up close, but very poor range and velocity. 10mm Auto is very strong, but much different than default",,,
57,5.0,‚≠ê,w,UMP45,Coyote Sight,Long Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,.45 Super,Excellent overall damage and range with relatively smooth yet shaky recoil. Extremely poor velocity makes it a little difficult to use at longer ranges,,,

64,49.0,‚≠ê,w,COLT SMG 633,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Exceptional reload speed and hipfire stability with very fast fire rate, but rather high vertical recoil when aimed. Amazing TTK up to medium range",,,

68,71.0,‚≠ê,q,M3A1,Delta Sight,Muzzle Booster,Vertical Grip,Retract Stock,.45 Super,A hidden gem from the PDW rebalance with absurd breakpoint ranges and recoil! Surprisingly versatile once you get adjusted to its low velocity and RPM,,,
69,74.0,,w,MP5/10,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,Default,One of the strongest three tap to RPM ratios in the game with excellent medium range performance and significant but controllable horizontal drift,,,
70,77.0,,q,UZI,Coyote Sight,Muzzle Brake,Vertical Grip,Extended Stock,Default,Excellent recoil with decent base damage and low fire rate. It also features a couple interesting conversions!,,,
71,80.0,,q,AUG A3 PARA XS,Delta Sight,Long Barrel,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Hollow Point,"The best of both the MP5 and MP5SD with a bit less RPM, but super long ranges! („Éé*¬∞‚ñΩ¬∞*)",,,
72,84.0,,q,K7,Delta Sight,Default,Pistol Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Nearly identical, if not better performance than the COLT SMG 633. Suppressed by default with pretty friendly recoil compared to the competition",,,

74,92.0,,q,PPSH-41,Delta Sight,Obrez Barrel,Yellow Laser,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,A sidegrade to the P90- drops the high penetration and medium range damage for extremely high reserve ammo and even faster RPM!,,,
75,98.0,,q,FAL PARA SHORTY,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Extend Stock,Default,"Powerful punch at all ranges with excellent handling. Somehow gets blown out of the water by the 50.63 PARA and 50.00 damage wise, but handles faster",,,
76,100.0,‚≠ê,q,KRISS VECTOR,Mini Sight,Long Barrel,Yellow Laser,Yellow Laser,.357 SIG,"Lightning fast time-to-kill with moderate recoil and extremely poor velocity. .357 SIG is the star of the show, but it's been greatly nerfed in v11.0.0",,,

124,0.0,‚≠ê,q,INTERVENTION,Vcog 6x Scope,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,Excellent starter sniper with rather forgiving velocity and torso kill range. I'm mixed about its buff (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢),,,

127,65.0,,q,BFG 50,ACOG Scope,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,"If you wanna turn your brain off for the day and just click on people, more power to you! But that doesn't make this weapon any less annoying (‚î¨‚î¨Ôπè‚î¨‚î¨)",,,
128,82.0,,q,AWM,Vcog 6x Scope,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Marksman Kit,.338 Norma,Jack of all trades with two interesting ammo flavors (‚ùÅ¬¥‚ó°`‚ùÅ) .338 Norma has crazy torso damage at all ranges (96+) even if you miss headshots,,,
129,84.0,,q,TRG-42,TA11 Acog,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,Default,A nearly direct upgrade to the INTERVENTION with additional torso kill range and velocity but slightly less RPM. Has some interesting conversions too,,,

133,138.0,,q,K14,KOM 10x42,Suppressor,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,.308 Win.,"Very fast handling and fire rate, but demands headshots more than other snipers. .308 Win fixes that issue while still being speedy („Éæ;Ôø£‚ñΩÔø£)„Éæ",,,
134,150.0,,q,HECATE II,Vcog 6x Scope,Heavy Barrel,Skeleton Grip,Remove Stock,.416 Barrett,A direct upgrade to the BFG 50 with significantly better RPM and uptime. The only real downside in comparison is how much more expensive it is lmao,,,
