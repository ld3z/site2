AK12,Z-Point,Muzzle Brake,Potato Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Hyperburst is still really good! Trust me (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢) Well rounded with very low automatic recoil and high velocity
AN-94,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Blue Laser,Blue Laser,7.62x39mm,"Lowest base recoil out of all assault rifles (¬∫ ‚ñ° ¬∫ l|l) High minimum damage with slow RPM, but a unique 1800 RPM initial burst every trigger pull!"
AS VAL,Delta Sight,Suppressor..?,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Extended Mag,"Good at everything, but has very slow velocity and reload speed. If you miss the higher RPM it used to have, check out the Vikhr Suppressor SR-3M!"
SCAR-L,Coyote Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,Extremely consistent long range performance with slow RPM and low recoil. Range reducing attachments don't hurt a lot as the weapon always four taps!
AUG A1,Coyote Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Very long range values and almost no recoil with the right setup! Comparable to the SCAR-L, trading a little base damage for fire rate"
M16A4,Delta Sight,Suppressor,Sideways Grip,Yellow Laser,6.5 Grendel,"I know this loadout looks crazy, but read the notes and the alt sheet!!! One of the best ARs with excellent recoil, fire rate, and customizability o(*¬∞‚ñΩ¬∞*)o"
G36,Comp Aimpoint,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Great minimum damage and penetration with good accuracy. 23 minimum damage allows the weapon to kill at any range with 3 limb shots and 1 headshot!
M16A1,Delta Sight,Muzzle Booster,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,M855,"Unique RPM heating mechanic with great handling and velocity. M855 is extremely powerful up close, but fires randomly deviating/tumbling bullets"
M16A3,Delta Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Ubiquitous meta AR- low recoil, great at doing everything. Burst grouping is extremely strong with 6.5 Grendel, check the alt sheet!!! (Ôæâ‚óï„ÉÆ‚óï)Ôæâ*. ‚úß "
TYPE 20,Mini Sight,ARS Suppressor,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Extended Mag,Does everything both the SCAR-L and AK74 can but with a tiny bit more base recoil. Extremely high base penetration and access to a 40rd magazine!
AUG A2,Barska Electro,Muzzle Brake,Pistol Grip,Green Laser,7.62x39mm,"Able to three tap up close compared to the AUG A1, but has less overall ranged damage. 7.62x39mm has very powerful base stats and overall performance"
K2,Delta Sight,Compensator,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Solid generalist auto in the same vein as the M16A3. Has the potential to three tap with a bonus torso multiplier, but has less friendly recoil in comparsion"
FAMAS F1,Mini Sight,ARS Suppressor,Angled Grip,FAMAS G2,Armor Piercing,High RPM with good range and moderate recoil. FAMAS G2 fires extremely fast and is one of the most powerful medium range autos in the game („Çú‚ñΩ„Çú*)
AK47,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Generally power crept by the STG-44. Very high damage with similar ranges to some battle rifles! High initial kick, but good overall full-auto accuracy"
AUG A3,Coyote Sight,T-Brake,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Less three tap range than the AUG A2, but much lower initial kick- overall accuracy is similar to the AUG A1. .300 BLK is interesting, but outclassed"
L85A2,Coyote Sight,ARS Suppressor,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"Nearly identical performance to the AUG A1. Fires slightly faster with higher penetration, but requires two headshots to three tap up close"
HK416,Comp Aimpoint,Squad Barrel,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Read the notes! Solid overall and very similar to the M16A3, firing slightly faster with less penetration and different recoil. Hollow points are strong here!"
AK74,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Sideways Grip,Green Laser,Default,"Very consistent and strong! Extremely low recoil with excellent damage and range, but slightly below average fire rate"
AKM,Mini Sight,Compensator,Romanian Grip,Green Laser,Hollow Point,"Significantly lower initial kick, but worse three tap range (90) compared to the AK47 (118) üçåBanana Mag üçå"
AK103,Delta Sight,BARS Barrel,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,Armor Piercing,"103: Friendlier recoil and further three tap to the AKM, lower min damage. 109: BORN TO SWAY || ACCURACY IS A F*** ||  410,757,864,530 DEAD PHANTOMS"
TAR-21,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Folding Grip,Yellow Laser,Armor Piercing,Read the underbarrel and ammo note please (lllÔø¢œâÔø¢) Excellent performance at all ranges with high multipliers and RPM but noticeable horizontal kick
TYPE 88,Mini Sight,T-Brake,Romanian Grip,Blue Laser,7.62x39mm,The TYPE 58 (7.62x39mm) is a direct upgrade to the AKM with better RPM and recoil! Default ammo is generally outclassed by the AK74 but has great hipfire
M231,Delta Sight,ARS Suppressor,Vertical Grip,Green Laser,Armor Piercing,Blisteringly fast fire rate which somewhat makes up for the atrocious recoil (^‚àá^*) Hipfire loadouts are very powerful and technically more accurate
C7A2,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Stubby Grip,Blue Laser,6.5 Grendel,"Lower recoil, lower damage M16A3. Read the barrel notes! You might find some gems rolling with the less conventional barrel attachments ‚îå(o^‚ñΩ^o)‚îò"
STG-44,Delta Sight,Compensator,Angled Grip,Blue Laser,5.56x45mm,"Very high potential with good recoil and damage, but a below average fire rate which punishes missed shots. One of the best overall assault rifles"
G11K2,Mini Sight,Muzzle Brake,Angled Grip,Yellow Laser,Default,Fast burst DMR with a 72 stud torso kill range. Buffed during the 2024 New Years update with greatly improved muzzle velocity and optic sway!
