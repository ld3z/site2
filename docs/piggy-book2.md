# **Piggy Book 2 Secret Ending**

This is a page which will instruct someone, on how to obtain [Book 2's](https://www.rolimons.com/gamebadge/2124855991) Secret Ending!

!!! info

    At least one person in your server must have every single badge in Book 1 and 2 (including all Plant, Factory, and other Lab endings). This does not include event badges and the Secret Badge from Book 1. If you are playing with someone who has all the required badges, make sure they (and you) have the Savior Ending toggled in your Settings. Switching servers or leaving while attempting the ending will reset all of your progress. It is recommended to do this in a private server. It is also recommended to have either alt accounts or other people to help get the badge.

# Phase 1:

!!! info

    Once you complete Phase 1, you will not need to complete it again unless you switch or leave the server.

## Step 1:

1. Select *Docks - Chapter 9* on any mode.

2. Complete the map without Pony being attacked. Please note that if you don't have all the badges and you are playing with someone who has them, then the player with all the required badges must be the one to complete the map with Pony following them, otherwise Step 2 won't commence. If you are playing with 3 or more players, it is recommended to have everyone else escape before the person with all the needed badges escapes.

## Step 2:

1. Select *Camp - Chapter 11* on Swarm mode.

2. Obtain the *Blue Key* and unlock the Blue Key door.

3. Inside, there will be a keypad. Enter the code `467854` in the keypad and press the green button with a tick mark on it. The interface should say "*PASSCODE ACCEPTED*".

4. You can either die to continue on with the next steps or beat the map, both will successfully count as completing this step.

# Phase 2:

!!! info

    The numbers that are revealed using the wrench and the order of the symbols on the keypad changes every round.

## Step 1:

1. Select *Lab - Chapter 12* on Bot mode (it is recommended to have someone distract the bot). You should see a keypad with symbols on the hallway to the left.

2. Find four vent covers around the map and remove them with the *Wrench*.

3. Each vent cover will reveal a number corresponding to the keypad.

4. Type in the code in letters onto the keypad, from the closest number to the farthest. If the code is correct, the keypad should say "*PASSCODE ACCEPTED*" and a cutscene will play. If the code is incorrect, the keypad will say "*SYSTEM LOCKED*" and cannot be used for the rest of the round, forcing you to play another round.

## Step 2:

You will have a boss battle against *TIO*, the main antagonist of the whole game. Abilities are disabled during this battle.

### Part 1:

1. When you spawn in, there will be number codes from the *Alleys* map. Input the code into the keypad to unlock the next room.

2. The next room has color codes from the *Ship* map. Start from the left wall and key in the colors in the direction of the arrows. Do the same thing for the right wall as well.

3. The next room has the numerical puzzle from the *Docks* map. Input the Roman Numerals onto the rotating pillar.

4. The next room has the symbol circle puzzle from the *Temple* map. The black arrow points into the middle of the circle. Ensure that the symbols are aligned to those on the wall.

5. The next room has the roulette puzzle from the *Camp* map. Press the dots that are colored red onto the roulette puzzle or press the buttons randomly, but the latter strategy does take time.

!!! tip

    The red dot on the wheel that is closest to the temple chapter always has an opposite, this means that if there is a red dot on the top left, there will be a red dot on the bottom right, the one closest to the roulette puzzle is always random.

6. Walk into the Black Void while avoiding the three purple traps in front of it.

### Part 2:

1. Once you get teleported, find and give items to the following NPCs: *Wooden Sword* for Pony, *The Pipe* for Zee, and the *Baseball Bat* for Georgie. After doing this, *TIO* will enter a rage state (the bot automatically knows where you are and chases you around), and the upstairs section of the map will open.

2. Go upstairs and give Doggy the bone, give Bunny the carrot, and give Zizzy the grass. Each one counts as one hit. Avoid the Shadow and White Sentinels. **The Shadow Sentinel is VERY HARD to see, so be extremely careful and alert as possible.**

3. After Doggy, Bunny, and Zizzy all hit *TIO* with their respective weapons, *TIO* will be defeated, a cutscene will play, and you should get the Hidden Ending badge and the ??? skin.

!!! question "I followed these steps and still didn't get the badge. What did I do wrong?"

    If you didn't get the badge, make sure to check the following:

      1. You (or someone else in the server) have all badges from both books, excluding any of the event badges, including all other badges from *Factory*, *Lab*, and *Plant*.

      2. You have the Savior Ending toggled in Settings, or else the keypad in *Camp* won't appear.

      3. If the keypad doesn't appear in *Camp*, then do Docks again and ensure the player with all the badges escapes with Pony following them.

      4. Make sure you're doing Swarm mode on the *Camp* map.

      5. Make sure you have 1:50 left on the timer on the *Lab* map for the second phase.
