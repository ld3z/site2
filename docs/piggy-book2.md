# **Piggy Book 2 Secret Ending**

This is a page which will instruct someone, on how to obtain [Book 2's](https://www.rolimons.com/gamebadge/2124855991) Secret Ending!

!!! info

    At least one person in your server must have every single badge in Book 1 and 2 (including all Plant, Factory, and other Lab endings). This does not include event badges and the Secret Badge from Book 1. If you are playing with someone who has all the required badges, make sure they (and you) have the Savior Ending toggled in your Settings. Switching servers or leaving while attempting the ending will reset all of your progress. It is recommended to do this in a private server. It is also recommended to have either alt accounts or other people to help get the badge.

# Phase 1:

!!! info

    Once you complete Phase 1, you will not need to complete it again unless you switch or leave the server.

## Step 1:

1. Select *Docks - Chapter 9* on any mode.

2. Complete the map without Pony being attacked. Please note that if you don't have all the badges and you are playing with someone who has them, then the player with all the required badges must be the one to complete the map with Pony following them, otherwise Step 2 won't commence. If you are playing with 3 or more players, it is recommended to have everyone else escape before the person with all the needed badges escapes.

## Step 2:

1. Select *Camp - Chapter 11* on Swarm mode.

2. Obtain the *Blue Key* and unlock the Blue Key door.

3. Inside, there will be a keypad. Enter the code `467854` in the keypad and press the green button with a tick mark on it. The interface should say "*PASSCODE ACCEPTED*".

4. You can either die to continue on with the next steps or beat the map, both will successfully count as completing this step.

# Phase 2:

!!! info

    The numbers that are revealed using the wrench and the order of the symbols on the keypad changes every round. You must follow the order of number below.

## Step 1:

1. Select *Lab - Chapter 12* on Bot mode (it is recommended to have someone distract the bot). You should see a keypad with symbols on the hallway to the left.

2. Find four vent covers around the map and remove them with the *Wrench*.

3. Each vent cover will reveal a number corresponding to the keypad.

4. Type in the code in letters onto the keypad, from the closest number to the farthest. If the code is correct, the keypad should say "*PASSCODE ACCEPTED*" and a cutscene will play. If the code is incorrect, the keypad will say "*SYSTEM LOCKED*" and cannot be used for the rest of the round, forcing you to play another round.
