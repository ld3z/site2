# **Piggy Book 2 Secret Ending**

This is a page which will instruct someone, on how to obtain [Book 2's](https://www.rolimons.com/gamebadge/2124855991) Secret Ending!

!!! info

    At least one person in your server must have every single badge in Book 1 and 2 (including all Plant, Factory, and other Lab endings). This does not include event badges and the Secret Badge from Book 1. If you are playing with someone who has all the required badges, make sure they (and you) have the Savior Ending toggled in your Settings. Switching servers or leaving while attempting the ending will reset all of your progress. It is recommended to do this in a private server. It is also recommended to have either alt accounts or other people to help get the badge.

# Phase 1:

!!! info

    Once you complete Phase 1, you will not need to complete it again unless you switch or leave the server.

## Step 1:

1. Select *Docks - Chapter 9* on any mode.

2. Complete the map without Pony being attacked. Please note that if you don't have all the badges and you are playing with someone who has them, then the player with all the required badges must be the one to complete the map with Pony following them, otherwise Step 2 won't commence. If you are playing with 3 or more players, it is recommended to have everyone else escape before the person with all the needed badges escapes.
