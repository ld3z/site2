This isn't so much as a game "guide" but more like a resource page.

If you still are having trouble, here is a table you could follow:

**Direction from the middle gravestone**|**Lantern's quote**|**Shovel's quote**|**Pickaxe's quote**
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:
Up|I can't believe I've won! Things are looking up!|Second place? I've had it up to here with second place!|Third place? I guess things can only go up from here!
Left|There's no way the others could have caught me! I left 'em in the dust!|Second place! The only thing left to do is get better for next year.|I thought I had left behind being a bum. Third place! What a joke.
Right|I'm the winner and all is right in the world.|I may have gotten second place, but I think I did all right.|It ain't right! I trained too hard only to come in third!
Down|I may have won, but I don't look down on anyone for trying to compete.|I've been down all morning, but this second place finish has me smiling!|Worse than last year! Down to third place.
Up Left|As a winner, I never gave up! Left 'em looking foolish!|If the judging was left up to me, I wouldn't be in second place.|All I can do is throw my hands up. Left to wallow in third place.
Up Right|Leave it to an upright citizen like me to win the whole thing!|I got up right at the crack of dawn just to come in second!?|They think they're better than me? They can stick it right up their nose!
Down Left|I was the first to the top, and those losers were left down at the bottom!|I left downtown in a hurry, and forgot my gear. I'll settle for second.|My pals cheered me on, but I let 'em down. Left the race in third.
Down Right|I always win! I am downright awesome!|Second place just ain't right! Down one place from last year.|It's downright criminal they let these other jokers compete.
