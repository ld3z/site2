# Piggy Book 1 True Ending

This is a page which will instruct someone, on how to obtain [Book 1's](https://www.rolimons.com/gamebadge/2124540781) True Ending!

!!! info

    **You must have all the badges from Chapters 1-12 in Piggy: Book 1, including both the Good and Bad endings on the Plant map. Leaving the server will reset your progress! It is recommended to attempt this ending in a private server. It is also recommended to have either alt accounts or other people to help get the badge.**

## Step 1:

1. Start a round on *City - Chapter 9*. The game mode must be Player + Bot! You must have at least one other person in the server with you, or the game will automatically choose Bot. If necessary, use an alt account or another person in your server to be the infected.

2. Complete the map as normal, but do not escape the map after you open the exit.

3. Walk over to the purple car, look underneath by moving your camera under the car, and grab the Mrs. P photo, just be careful not to get killed while trying to grab it.

!!! warning

    If you pick up another item while holding the photo, it will disappear, and you will have to restart the map. It's recommended to either:

       1. Unlock the exit before grabbing the photo and escaping.

       2. Or if you are playing with another player(s), have either you or them complete the map while you or they are holding the photo, then escape once the exit is open without dying.

Escape the map with the photo equipped in your hand. You can skip the cutscene.

!!! danger

    **Make sure that you do not leave the server after completing Step 1, if you do, then your progress will reset and you will have to start from the beginning.**

## Step 2:

1. Pick *Plant - Chapter 12* on any gamemode and escape like normal. When you finish the map, DO NOT skip the cutscene! Walk towards Mr. P like you would in the *Bad Ending*, and watch the full cutscene.

2. You will get different dialogue, a different cutscene, and the end credits will change. After the cutscene ends, you will be awarded the badge and the Mr. P skin.

!!! question "I followed these steps and still didn't get the badge. What did I do wrong?"

    If you didn't get the badge, make sure to check the following:

      1. You have **all** of the badges for Book 1, including both the Good and Bad endings of Plant.

      2. You are holding the photo when you escape the City, and not just keeping it in your inventory.

      3. Not leaving the server after finishing the City map.

      4. Not skipping the cutscene after you escape the Plant map. This will skip the ability to choose an ending and **resets everything**.
